### Summary
Software developer with two years of application and proof of concept development

### Languages
Most expirienced with Java and Python

Some expirience with SQL and JavaScript with jQuery

### Experience
#### Software developer
##### Hewlette Packard / Hewlette Packard Enterprise - June 2014 to Present
Led a team on the development of an application to monitor and collect data from fibre channel switches by using the REST APIs that they offer. The application also provides a uniform rest interface for all of the switches that it interacts with allowing multiple different switches to be controlled with the same code. 

Rebuilt a script from the ground up to assist new users with the first time configuration of a switch.

Designed and developed various proof of concept applications

Assisted in lab duties, including server setup and configuration

#### Automation Intern
##### American Tower Corporation - Summer 2013
Automated build and deployment processes, saving the development team over 60 hours per week.

Contributed code to the revamped website, which launched shortly after departure.

### Publications
#### Enhancing Plug and Play Capabilities in Body Area Network Protocols
This project aimed to create a plug-and-play protocol for Body Area Networks (BANs). This protocol enables communication between a diverse number of devices and a base station, regardless of equipment manufacturer. Previous BANs rely on proprietary software, or protocols that are specialized to the physical device. Our protocol takes a more universal approach, allowing any device to participate in a BAN without introducing any significant overhead or running cost to the operation of that BAN. Unlike previous approaches, any existing motes and the base station will not have to be updated. Only new devices being added to the BAN will have to implement the protocol before connecting. Our protocol introduces overhead that reduced the performance and lifetime of the motes used in our BAN.

### School Projects
#### Interactive Qualifying Project
We continued the development of a iOS mobile application for deployment in WPI Biology laboratories to serve as an alternative to traditionally lab conventions. Special attention was made to delivering a well-designed and well-documented application to ensure the ease of expanding the application in the future.

#### Citizen Science: Nematodes
Worked with the Biology department to create a web application in perl to allow regular people to contribute to a real scientific project.

### Education
#### Worcester Polytechnic Institute
Worcester, Massachusetts
Bachelor of Sciences in Computer Science
